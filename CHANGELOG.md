## 0.1.3 - Very small patch

Changes:

- I ended up deciding to remove the .syntax--none style (really no uses and the true scope for the none keyword is generally constant.none that is just the .syntax--constant style).
I was initially about to only remove the background since it fucked-up with the selection background, but since I was keeping it just as a joke, here we are.
